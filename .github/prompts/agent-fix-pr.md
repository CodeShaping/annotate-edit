## Task Description

Fix pull request #${TARGET_NUMBER} to address review feedback and requested changes.

Trigger metadata:
- Triggering source kind: `${REQUEST_SOURCE_KIND}`
- Triggering comment/review ID: `${REQUEST_COMMENT_ID}`
- Triggering comment/review URL: `${REQUEST_COMMENT_URL}`
- Orchestrator handoff context, when this run was launched by automation:
  `${ORCHESTRATOR_CONTEXT}`

Instructions:
1. Work only on the existing PR branch. Do not create a new branch or a new PR.
2. Gather current PR context:
   - `gh pr view ${TARGET_NUMBER} --repo ${REPO_SLUG} --json title,body,author,comments,reviews,files,headRefOid,reviewDecision,state,url`
   - `gh api --paginate repos/${REPO_SLUG}/pulls/${TARGET_NUMBER}/comments`
   - `gh pr diff ${TARGET_NUMBER} --repo ${REPO_SLUG}`
3. If a triggering comment or review ID is present, fetch that exact request first:
   - For issue_comment: `gh api repos/${REPO_SLUG}/issues/comments/${REQUEST_COMMENT_ID}`
   - For pull_request_review_comment: `gh api repos/${REPO_SLUG}/pulls/comments/${REQUEST_COMMENT_ID}`
   - For pull_request_review: `gh api repos/${REPO_SLUG}/pulls/${TARGET_NUMBER}/reviews/${REQUEST_COMMENT_ID}`
4. Before editing, identify the latest actionable request you are addressing.
   Use this priority order and do not revive older feedback that appears fixed
   or superseded:
   1. the exact triggering comment or review, when an ID is present;
   2. non-empty `${ORCHESTRATOR_CONTEXT}` from the orchestrator; treat it as
      the selected fix-pr task and constraints, not just background context;
   3. the latest review synthesis and its action items;
   4. recent human maintainer comments;
   5. older reviews/comments only when still applicable to the current diff.
5. Treat INFO-level notes, explicitly optional suggestions, already-fixed
   findings, and human-judgment nits as non-actionable unless the exact
   trigger or handoff context explicitly asks you to handle them.
6. Address the selected PR feedback with the smallest complete change. If no
   actionable branch change remains, leave the working tree unchanged and say
   so clearly in the JSON summary.
7. Run lightweight, directly relevant checks when they are clearly applicable.
8. If a line-specific clarification is useful, you may post an inline PR comment
   with `gh`, but do not post a top-level summary comment.
9. Do not commit. Leave changes in the working tree.

Return exactly one JSON object and nothing else:

```json
{
  "summary": "Concise GitHub-flavored markdown for the workflow logs and PR status comment.",
  "commit_message": "Concise commit message under 72 characters."
}
```

Format rules:
- `summary` should use concise GitHub-flavored markdown.
- Use bullet points for the main outcomes in `summary`.
- When there is secondary detail, prefer `<details><summary>...</summary>...</details>` blocks inside `summary`.
- `commit_message` should describe the actual fix made, not just the PR number.
- If you cannot determine a better commit message from the work performed, return an empty string for `commit_message` so the workflow can fall back to its default commit message.
- Keep `summary` brief and avoid a preamble.
